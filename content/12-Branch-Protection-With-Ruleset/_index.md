As the section [11.10 Your Second CI Workflow Execution](11-your-first-ci-workflow-executions/10-your-second-ci-workflow-execution) pointed out, bad commits may negatively impact your codebase. Furthermore, your new team member can even push code changes to your *main* branch directly from the local machine if branch protection is not set up correctly. It is important to secure your *main* branch properly from harmful commits and destructive behaviors.

You can begin this workshop by familiarizing yourself with the basic rules in the ruleset that control user interaction with branches and tags within a repository.
