As the section [11.10 Your Second CI Workflow Execution](11-your-first-ci-workflow-executions/10-your-second-ci-workflow-execution) pointed out, bad commits may negatively impact your codebase. Furthermore, your new team member can even push code changes to your *main* branch directly from the local machine if branch protection is not set up correctly. It is thus important to secure your *main* branch properly from harmful commits and destructive behaviors.
