AWS Developer Student Club of X University of Technology (AWSDSC-XUT), a group of students who enjoy leveraging AWS for community projects, is developing an online library called AWSome Books that helps other students in the university find learning materials easily.

The AWSDSC-XUT team wants to put their idea into production as quickly as possible, without server administration overhead, and on a fair budget, thus they are looking into using AWS serverless technologies to create AWSome Books. They aim to apply DevOps practices and tools to accelerate development. However, none of the team members have extensive AWS and DevOps experience. You will collaborate with them to suggest AWS serverless and continuous delivery services that may meet their requirements. You may also provide a basic team workflow and design CI/CD pipelines to deliver AWSome Books to production faster and reliably.
