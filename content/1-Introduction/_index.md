The AWS Developer Student Club at X University of Technology (AWSDSC-XUT) — a group of students who love leveraging AWS to build non-profit projects — is developing a containerized API application called AWSome Books, designed to make accessing instructional resources easier for students.

The team is eager to bring AWSome Books to life quickly and efficiently, without the burden of managing servers and within a reasonable budget. To achieve this, they are exploring AWS technologies to power their solution. Embracing CI/CD pipeline practices and AWS services is central to their strategy, but the team members are relatively new to AWS services required to build AWSome Books and CI/CD design.

You will collaborate with them to recommend the most suitable AWS services, design an effective team workflow, and create CI/CD pipelines that streamline the deployment of AWSome Books to production, ensuring a fast and reliable launch.

With a reliable CI/CD pipeline and AWS services taking care of the heavy lifting of infrastructure deployment and management, the team can focus on delivering the real value of AWSome Books more quickly, which is to give students throughout the university easy access to learning materials.
