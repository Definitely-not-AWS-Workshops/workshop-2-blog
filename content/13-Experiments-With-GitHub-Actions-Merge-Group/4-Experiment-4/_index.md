If you skip pulling the latest updates from the remote *main* branch and do not test them with your local changes, you might overlook issues that only emerge during the remote CI process. To avoid this, make sure to update your local branch with the latest code from *main* before submitting your pull request. This way, you can catch potential issues early and ensure a smoother CI experience.
